# SpliceFinder Tutorial
SpliceFinder applies convolutional neural network to classify sequences to donor, acceptor or non-splice-site. With a sliding window, it can predict the exact positions of every splice site on long genomic sequences with less false  positives and high recall.


### This was a hands-on tutorial during a ML in Bioinformatics Summer School in 2020
